* 4gl-mode
  This is a very rudimentary 4gl-mode that I have made based on the vim 4gl-mode.
  The mode will be provide syntax highlighting, smart indentation and snippets.
  I primarily work on the generos [[http:www.4js.com/online_documentation/fjs-gas-manual-html/][4js generos 4gl dialect]].

  I am still relatively new with emacs-lisp and will be modifying this semi-regularily.

  Current status: very broken
  
* TODO
  - Clean up code and document functions
  - Fix indentation logic
  - Add more snippets
